# ðŸ“° Fake News Detection using LSTM and GloVe

This project aims to classify news articles as **real** or **fake** using deep learning techniques. A Long Short-Term Memory (LSTM) model was trained using pre-trained **GloVe word embeddings** to capture contextual meanings of words. The model achieves a classification accuracy of approximately **94â€“96%**.
